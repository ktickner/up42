Tech Challenge for UP42

## To Run

Use command `yarn start`. This will install dependencies and run the app in `localhost:3000`. \
A browser window should open automatically.

## Packages

### Create React App

Just a super simple way to get started, so I bootstrapped using this.

### Material-UI

Feature rich, themeable UI library. I chose this as I have used it in the past so I am familiar, it's fairly feature complete, and stable.
It is also built on emotion, so it is easy to extend to custom styling where appropriate.
